// I. Variables & Datatypes

// 1. How do we assign a value to a variable?
// use the assignment operator '=' to assign a value
// ex: const thing1 = 'the thing';

// 2. How do we change the value of a variable?
// we use the assignment operator; variables created with 'let' can be changed to different data types, while 
// variables created with 'const' cannot
// ex: let someNum = 5;
// someNum = 10;

// 3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
// we can use the assignment operator '=' to assign the value of the existing variable to a new variable
// ex: let num1 = 7;
// let num2 = num1;  // num2 is now equal to 7;

// 4. Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
// declare a variable using either the 'let' or 'const' keyword
// assign a value to the variable using the assignment operator '='
// define the data type of the variable (string, number, boolean, array, object) or initialize to null

// 5. What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
// pseudocoding involves writing out what you want the code to do, using a combination of code and human-readable language
// it helps plan out how your application will work by breaking up your code into smaller chunks, and helps save time when actually coding
// because ideas are planned out better
// it should describe the entire logic of a problem, so you're ultimately transposing it into actual code

// 6. What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
// Should spend about 75-90% of your time thinking about/planning how you're going to solve a problem, and about 10-25% of your time
// actually typing in the code to solve it
